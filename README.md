Shashank Adepu — Embedded Systems & Firmware Engineer

Engineer focused on bare-metal, RTOS, Embedded Linux, and low-level driver development.
Working as Software Engineer 2 (Embedded) at Mirafra Technologies.

I build systems close to the metal — deterministic firmware, hardware interfaces, kernel-side drivers, and board bring-up workflows.

Core Skills (Deep, Not Buzzwords)
Embedded Firmware

C for microcontrollers (STM32, ESP32, Cortex-M)

Clock config, timers, NVIC, peripheral drivers

Memory maps, linker scripts, startup code

Real-Time Systems

FreeRTOS internals: context switching, scheduler behavior, queues/semaphores

Deterministic task design, latency debugging

Embedded Linux

Linux Device Drivers (char/misc, file ops, DT bindings)

Kernel build system, cross-compiling, module debugging

Yocto bring-up on STM32MP1 (u-boot → kernel → rootfs flow)

Digital & HDL

100+ HDLBits solved — combinational, sequential, FSMs

Comfortable with Verilog basics and simulation mindsets

Debugging

UART/SPI/I2C analyzers

printf-less debugging

Segfaults, race conditions, IRQ faults

Memory corruption → trace & isolate

Real-world hardware issues, not textbook theory

Work & Background

Software Engineer 2 (Embedded), Mirafra Technologies
Working on low-level firmware + Linux driver stack.

Switched career from Cloud/NOC support → Embedded full-time.

23 years old, running a clean 10 LPA comp with 1.5 years of experience.

GATE 2024 AIR 9467.

Building long-term expertise in LDD + real-time firmware.

Current Focus Areas

Kernel subsystems

Concurrency primitives and locking mechanisms

DMA engines & high-performance IO paths

Improving firmware architecture for scalability

Clean driver abstractions

Bare-metal + RTOS hybrid systems

Selected Projects (Not the Toy Ones)

Gesture-based Media Controller (Ultrasonic + Arduino)

Yocto bring-up on STM32MP1 (full boot chain)

Custom peripheral drivers on STM32 (SPI, timers, GPIO IRQ)

LDD practice drivers — char dev, file ops, blocking/non-blocking IO

More coming as I deepen kernel driver work
